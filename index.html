						<h3>Authoritative Data on U.S. Exporting</h3>
						<p>The Data Services Platform from the International Trade Administration (ITA) provides direct access to authoritative information on U.S. exporting and international trade via standard APIs.  ITA has built the platform to be the central source for exporting data important to small and medium sized U.S. businesses.</p>
						<p>The data and information is intended specifically for public use and dissemination.  We encourage software developers to integrate the data into their applications and mash-ups to help U.S. small business owners expand their business overseas while creating jobs at home.</p>
						<p>Documentation for all APIs can be found on this developer portal.  Please review the list of <a href="api-list.html" class="bold">all available APIs</a> from ITA to learn how to work with them. We will continue to add APIs as they become available.</p>

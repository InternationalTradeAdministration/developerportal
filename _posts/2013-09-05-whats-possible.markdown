Developers have a wealth of opportunities to turn ITA's trade information into useful and valuable applications for exporters.  Immediate ideas for using the trade information include:

- Add [ITA's Trade Event](trade-events.html), [Trade Leads](trade-leads.html), [Market Research](market-research-library.html), and [Trade News & Articles](trade-news-articles.html) to specific _Country_ pages.
- Create a widget that aggregates event information, including [ITA's Trade Events](trade-events.html), for businesses in particular industries.
- Include [ITA's Offices & Centers](ita-office-locations) in a list of resources for businesses in a particular State.

#Demo Search Apps

ITA has developed simple search apps for each API designed to help users easily see the data available at each endpoint. Developers can also use the code for these demo apps as building-blocks for their own search applications.  The code uses the Ember JavaScript framework and can be found on [ITAâ€™s GitHub repo](https://github.com/InternationalTradeAdministration/explorer).

Each API has an associated search app for demonstration purposes:

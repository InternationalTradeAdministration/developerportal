## Consolidated Screening List Widget

The [Consolidated Screening List](consolidated-screening-list.html) widget searches eleven export screening lists from the Departments of Commerce, State and the Treasury.  The widget enables your customers to do a quick screening search for people or companies with whom they are doing business or are party to their overseas transactions.

The widget returns results that are either exact matches and near matches in case your customers donâ€™t have the exact spelling of the name.  The closer the match, the higher the name in the results.

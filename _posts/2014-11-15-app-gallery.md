#App Gallery

ITA encourages developers to use the trade data in its APIs to build applications. These data sets are particularly valuable because they originate from authoritative, federal government sources. Developers should build applications that benefit businesses who export their products and services overseas. They can also enhance their existing applications by mashing ITA’s data with other trade-related data.

We are particularly interested in applications that help businesses:

* Learn about exporting
* Get ready to export
* Expand their existing exporting business.

ITA has developed [simple search apps for each API](demo-search-apps.html) designed to help users easily see the data available at each endpoint.  Developers can also use the code for these demo apps as building-blocks for their own search applications.

# Consolidated Screening List API

{% include csl-tabs %}

##Resource URL
This endpoint will search across all nine screening lists. It returns exact matches only at this time -- a user must perform searches on the exact spelling for a name.  To search a subset, see sources below.

## ITA’s Process for Consolidating the Screening Lists

ITA’s data services platform imports each of the nine screening lists once a day.  It then consolidates the lists based on common field types such as name, Federal Register Notice number, and Start Date.  Not all lists contain the same fields so some search results may include more detail than others depending upon the Source agency.  Once the data services platform consolidates the lists, it publishes the [CSL API endpoint](http://api.govwizely.com/consolidated_screening_list/search).

There can be a time lag of up to one day between the time a Source has updated a screening list and when that update appears in the Consolidated Screening List API. Furthermore, the Consolidated Screening List API is not the system of record for these screening lists.  Developers should strongly encourage users to refer to the website of the source agency for further instructions when finding a potential match.  Links to these websites are found above as well as in the “Source List URL” and “Source Information URL” fields that accompany each party returned in the API.

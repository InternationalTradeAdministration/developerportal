###International Trade Administration Application Programming Interface 

###Terms of Service Agreement

The International Trade Administration offers some of its public data in machine-readable format via an Application Programming Interface ("API"). This service is offered subject to your acceptance of the terms and conditions contained herein as well as any relevant sections of the trade.gov Information Quality Guidelines (http://www.ita.doc.gov/ITAiqs.pdf) and Privacy Policy (http://trade.gov/privacy.asp) (collectively, the "Agreements").

###Scope

All of the content, documentation, code and related materials made available to you through the API are subject to these terms. Access to or use of the API or its content constitutes acceptance to this Agreement.

###Use

You may use the International Trade Administration API to develop a service or service to search, display, analyze, retrieve, view and otherwise "get" information from International Trade Administration data.

###Attribution

All services, which utilize or access the API, should display the following notice prominently within the application: "This product uses the International Trade Administrationâ€™s Data API but is not endorsed or certified by the International Trade Administration." You may use the International Trade Administration name in order to identify the source of API content subject to these rules. You may not use the International Trade Administration name, or the like to imply endorsement of any product, service, or entity, not-for-profit, commercial or otherwise.

###Modification or False Representation of Content

You may not modify or falsely represent content accessed through the API and still claim the source is the International Trade Administration.

###Right to Limit

Your use of the API may be subject to certain limitations on access, calls, or use as set forth within this Agreement or otherwise provided by the International Trade Administration. If the International Trade Administration reasonably believes that you have attempted to exceed or circumvent these limits, your ability to use the API may be temporarily or permanently blocked. The International Trade Administration may monitor your use of the API to improve the service or to insure compliance with this Agreement.

###Service Termination

If you wish to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by refraining from further use of the API. The International Trade Administration reserves the right (though not the obligation) to: (1) refuse to provide the API to you, if it is the International Trade Administration's opinion that use violates any International Trade Administration policy; or (2) terminate or deny you access to and use of all or part of the API at any time for any other reason in its sole discretion. All provisions of this Agreement, which by their nature should survive termination, shall survive termination including, without limitation, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

###Changes

The International Trade Administration reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement, in whole or in part. Your continued use of or access to the API following posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those modified terms. The International Trade Administration may in the future, offer new services and/or features through the API. Such new features and/or services shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

###Disclaimer of Warranties

The API is provided "as is" and on an "as-available" basis. The International Trade Administration hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including without limitation the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The International Trade Administration makes no warranty that the API will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted.

###Limitations on Liability

In no event will the International Trade Administration be liable with respect to any subject matter of this Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (1) any special, incidental, or consequential damages; (2) the cost of procurement of substitute products or services; or (3) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data.

###General Representations

You hereby warrant that: (1) your use of the API will be in strict accordance with the International Trade Administration privacy policy, this Agreement, and all applicable laws and regulations; and (2) your use of the API will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party.

###Miscellaneous

This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the International Trade Administration and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and may only be modified by the posting of a revised version on this page by the International Trade Administration.

###Disputes

Any disputes arising out of this Agreement and access to or use of the API shall be governed by federal law.

###No Waiver Rights

The International Trade Administration's failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute waiver of such right or provision.

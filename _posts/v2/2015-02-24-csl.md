**Note:**

It has been discovered that erroneous entries have been appearing on the Non-SDN Iranian Sanction Act List (NS-ISA) in the CSL API. A change is being made to alter metadata that were incorrectly associated with these records.  The names in question are on OFAC’s EO13599 list and US persons are prohibited from dealing with them.

If you have any question regarding this change, please e-mail us at DataServices@trade.gov Thank you.

## Resource URL

This endpoint will search across all screening lists.  To search a subset, see sources below.

{% include screening-list/csl-query.html %}

## Search Parameters for Consolidated Screening List Sources

### keyword

Searches for a match within the **name**, **alt_names**, **remarks**, and **title** fields from all eleven lists.

    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&q={term}

**_Example_**

{% include screening-list/csl-query-keyword.html %}

### sources

Searches only the lists specified by the **Source** Abbreviation.

    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&sources={csl_type}

**_Example_**

{% include screening-list/csl-query-source.html %}

For each list, the Source Abbreviations are as follows:

**Department of Commerce – Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)**  
   Denied Persons List = **DPL**  
   Entity List = **EL**  
   Unverified List = **UVL**  

**Department of State – Bureau of International Security and Non-Proliferation**  
   Nonproliferation Sanctions = **ISN**  
 
**Department of State – Directorate of Defense Trade Controls**  
   ITAR Debarred = **DTC**  

**Department of Treasury - Office of Foreign Assets Control**  
   Blocked Solely Pursuant to Executive Order 13599 = **13599**  
   Correspondent Account or Payable-Through Account Sanctions (CAPTA) = **CAP**  
   Foreign Sanctions Evaders = **FSE**  
   Palestinian Legislative Council List = **PLC**  
   Part 561 List = **561**  
   Sectoral Sanctions Identifications List = **SSI**  
   Specially Designated Nationals = **SDN**  

### countries

Searches only entities whose **country, nationalities,** or **citizenships** fields match the country code based on [ISO alpha-2 country codes](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/country_codes/country_names_and_code_elements.htm). The **country** fields are found in the **addresses** and **ids** arrays. This method allows you to search for multiple countries (plural) separated by commas but will only return one country (singular) per entity.  

    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&countries={country code}

**_Example_**

{% include screening-list/csl-query-country.html %}

### address

Searches against fields in the **addresses** array.

    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&address={query}

**_Example_**

{% include screening-list/csl-query-address.html %}

### name

Searches against the **name** and **alt_names** fields.  

    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&name={query}

**_Example_**

{% include screening-list/csl-query-name.html %}
 
### fuzzy_name

Fuzzy name matching enables users to query a name and get usable results without knowing the exact spelling of an entry. 
It works by expanding queries to include results that are *fuzzily* similar to the given term, where similarity 
is defined by *distance* - the number of changes required to get from one term to another. 

The following example contains terms with a distance of 1. Valid transformation types are given in parenthesis. 

    star => stir  (substitution)
    star => stars (insertion)
    star => tar   (deletion)
    star => tsar  (transposition)

This notion of distance between strings is defined formally as [Damerau–Levenshtein distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance)

We allow for fuzzy matching up to a distance of 2. For example, a search for *Smith*, will return matches on the following 
variants of the name (among others).
 
| query term | distance |
|------------|----------|
| Smith | 0 |
| Smyth  | 1 |
| Smithy  | 1 | 
| Smythe  | 2 |
| Stitch | 2 |
| ... |
	
Fuzzy matching can be particularly helpful with names that are commonly transliterated into English in various ways.

Results from a fuzzy name search include a **score**. The higher the score, the more closely the query term matches an entry in the consolidated screening list. 

**Note**: The *fuzzy_name* parameter only works in tandem with *name*. Set *fuzzy_name=true* to utilize fuzzy name matching when searching against the **name** and **alt_names** fields.  The default setting for *fuzzy_name* is *false*, which means the endpoint will only return exact matches.

    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&name={query}&fuzzy_name=true

Also, special characters such as hashtags (#) and ampersands (&) contained in a need to be URL encoded; e.g., *AT&T* should be encoded as *at%26t*.

**_Example_**

{% include screening-list/csl-query-fuzzy-name.html %}


### type

Searches based on the type of the entry (e.g, Individual, Entity, Vessel).

	{{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&type={entry type}

**_Example_**

{% include screening-list/csl-query-type.html %}

### start_date

Returns entries based on their start date.  Dates are filtered by comparing them against an inclusive range, which must be entered with the following format:  YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd.  Searching on a single date can be done by entering the same value for the start and end of the range.


    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&start_date={YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd}

**_Example_**

{% include screening-list/csl-query-startdate.html %}

### end_date

Returns entries based on their end date.  Dates are filtered by comparing them against an inclusive range, which must be entered with the following format:  YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd.  Searching on a single date can be done by entering the same value for the start and end of the range.


    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&end_date={YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd}

**_Example_**

{% include screening-list/csl-query-enddate.html %}

### issue_date

Returns entries based on the issue dates of the ids array.  Dates are filtered by comparing them against an inclusive range, which must be entered with the following format:  YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd.  Searching on a single date can be done by entering the same value for the start and end of the range.


    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&issue_date={YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd}

**_Example_**

{% include screening-list/csl-query-issuedate.html %}

### expiration_date

Returns entries based on the expiration dates of the ids array.  Dates are filtered by comparing them against an inclusive range, which must be entered with the following format:  YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd.  Searching on a single date can be done by entering the same value for the start and end of the range.


    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&expiration_date={YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd}

**_Example_**

{% include screening-list/csl-query-expirationdate.html %}

### sort

Returns entries sorted by the provided field name.  The possible fields to sort by are **name**, **start_date**, **issue_date**, **end_date**, and **expiration_date**.

Enter the field name followed by a colon, then the desired order **asc** (ascending) or **desc** (descending).  For example, **start_date:desc** sorts results from most recent start date to earliest.  Entries that do not contain the entered field or contain a null or empty value will be returned after the sorted results.

**Note:**  By default, searches that do not contain a full-text search (**q**, **name**, **address**) will return results by **name:asc** even if no sort parameter is entered.


    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&sort={fieldname:order}

**_Example_**

{% include screening-list/csl-query-sort.html %}

### size + offset

The **size** parameter allows you to configure the number of results to be returned up to a maximum of 100. The **offset** parameter defines the offset from the first result you want to fetch. Unless specified the API returns 10 results at a time.

    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&size={1 to 100}&offset={1 to n}
    
**_Example_**

{% include screening-list/csl-query-size.html %}

**Note:** When using multiple parameters, the result set will contain the intersection of the matches determined by the parameter values.

##  ITA’s Process for Consolidating the Screening Lists

ITA’s data services platform imports each of the eleven screening lists once every hour.  It then consolidates the lists based on common field types such as name, federal_register_notice, and start_date.  Not all lists contain the same fields so some search results may include more detail than others depending upon the Source agency.  Once the data services platform consolidates the lists, it publishes the [CSL API endpoint](http://api.govwizely.com/consolidated_screening_list/search).

There can be a time lag of up to one hour between the time a Source has updated a screening list and when that update appears in the Consolidated Screening List API. Furthermore, the Consolidated Screening List API is not the system of record for these screening lists.  Developers should strongly encourage users to refer to the website of the source agency for further instructions when finding a potential match.  Links to these websites are found above as well as in the “Source List URL” and “Source Information URL” fields that accompany each party returned in the API.

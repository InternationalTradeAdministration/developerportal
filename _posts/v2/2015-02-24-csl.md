#Consolidated Screening List API

{% include csl-tabs %}

##Resource URL

This endpoint will search across all eleven screening lists. It returns exact matches only at this time -- a user must perform searches on the exact spelling for a name.  To search a subset, see sources below.

{% include csl-query.html %}

##Search Parameters for consolidated screening list sources

###keyword

Searches for a match within the **name**, **alt_names**, **remarks**, and **title** fields from all eleven lists.

    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&q={term}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-keyword.html %}

###sources

Searches only the lists specified by the **Source** Abbreviation.

    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&sources={csl_type}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-source.html %}

Source Abbreviations as follows:

* Denied Persons List = **DPL**
* Entity List = **EL**
* Foreign Sanctions Evaders = **FSE**
* ITAR Debarred = **DTC**
* Non-SDN Iranian Sanctions Act List = **ISA**
* Nonproliferation Sanctions = **ISN**
* Palestinian Legislative Council List = **PLC**
* Part 561 List = **561**
* Sectoral Sanctions Identifications List = **SSI**
* Specially Designated Nationals - **SDN**
* Unverified List = **UVL**

###countries

Searches only entities whose **country** field matches the country code based on [ISO alpha-2 country codes](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/country_codes/country_names_and_code_elements.htm). This method allows you to search for multiple countries (plural) separated by commas but will only return one country (singular) per entity.  

    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&countries={country code}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-country.html %}

###address

Searches against fields in the **addresses** array.

    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&address={query}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-address.html %}

###name

Searches against the **name** and **alt_names** fields.  

    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&name={query}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-name.html %}
 
###fuzzy_name

Fuzzy name matching enables users to query a name and get usable results without knowing the exact spelling of an entry. 
It works by expanding queries to include results that are *fuzzily* similar to the given term, where similarity 
is defined by **distance** - the number of changes required to get from one term to another. 

The following example contains terms with a distance of 1. Valid transformation types are given in parenthesis. 

    star => stir  (substitution)
    star => stars (insertion)
    star => tar   (deletion)
    star => tsar  (transposition)

This notion of distance between strings is defined formally as [Damerau–Levenshtein distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance)

We allow for fuzzy matching up to a distance of 2. For example, a search for *Mohamed*, will return matches on the following 
variants of the name (among others).
 
| query term | distance |
|------------|----------|
| Mohamed | 0 |
| Mohamad  | 1 |
| Muhamed  | 1 | 
| Muhamet  | 2 |
| Mohammed | 1 |
| Muhammed | 2 |
| ... |
	
Fuzzy matching can be particularly helpful with names that are commonly transliterated into English in various ways.

Results from a fuzzy name search include a **score**. The higher the score, the more closely the query term matches an entry in the consolidated screening list. Queries return one of the following values:

| Score | Rule | Explanation |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 100 | Exact match | The query string, taken as an unbroken unit, matches. |
| 95 | Near match | Each word in the query string matches. |
| 90 | Distance = 1 (uniform) | The entire query string matches at a distance of 1. |
| 85 | Distance = 1 (composite) | Each word in the query string matches at a distance of 1. |
| 80 | Distance = 2 (uniform) | The entire query string matches at a distance of 2. |
| 75 | Distance = 2 (composite) | Each word in the query string matches at a distance of 2. |
| - | No match | There was either no match or the distance to match would be greater than 2. |

**Note**: The *fuzzy_name* parameter only works in tandem with *name*. Set *fuzzy_name=true* to utilize fuzzy name matching when searching against the **name** and **alt_names** fields.  The default setting for *fuzzy_name* is *false*, which means the endpoint will only return exact matches.

    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&name={query}&fuzzy_name=true

Also, special characters such as hashtags (#) and ampersands (&) contained in a need to be URL encoded; e.g., *AT&T* should be encoded as *at%26t*.

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-fuzzy-name.html %}


###type

Searches based on the type of the entry (e.g, Individual, Entity, Vessel).

	{{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&type={entry type}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-type.html %}

###start_date

Returns entries based on their start date.  Dates are filtered by comparing them against an inclusive range, which must be entered with the following format:  YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd.  Searching on a single date can be done by entering the same value for the start and end of the range.


    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&start_date={YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-startdate.html %}

###end_date

Returns entries based on their end date.  Dates are filtered by comparing them against an inclusive range, which must be entered with the following format:  YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd.  Searching on a single date can be done by entering the same value for the start and end of the range.


    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&end_date={YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-enddate.html %}

###issue_date

Returns entries based on the issue dates of the ids array.  Dates are filtered by comparing them against an inclusive range, which must be entered with the following format:  YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd.  Searching on a single date can be done by entering the same value for the start and end of the range.


    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&issue_date={YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-issuedate.html %}

###expiration_date

Returns entries based on the expiration dates of the ids array.  Dates are filtered by comparing them against an inclusive range, which must be entered with the following format:  YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd.  Searching on a single date can be done by entering the same value for the start and end of the range.


    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&expiration_date={YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-expirationdate.html %}

###size + offset

The **size** parameter allows you to configure the number of results to be returned up to a maximum of 100. The **offset** parameter defines the offset from the first result you want to fetch. Unless specified the API returns 10 results at a time.

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-size.html %}

##Last Updated and Last Imported

Recency information about each source queried is given in **sources_used** in the following fieldss

| Field	| Description |
| ------| -------------|
| source | The name of the list and the issuing agency. |
| source_last_updated | The most recent date and time the list changed. |
| last_imported | The most recent date and time the list was imported. |

The *source_last_updated* field reflects the most recent date and time we noticed that the issuing agency had updated their list. We check for updates and import lists at the same time daily.

## ITA’s Process for Consolidating the Screening Lists

ITA’s data services platform imports each of the eleven screening lists once a day.  It then consolidates the lists based on common field types such as name, Federal Register Notice number, and Start Date.  Not all lists contain the same fields so some search results may include more detail than others depending upon the Source agency.  Once the data services platform consolidates the lists, it publishes the [CSL API endpoint](http://api.govwizely.com/consolidated_screening_list/search).

There can be a time lag of up to one day between the time a Source has updated a screening list and when that update appears in the Consolidated Screening List API. Furthermore, the Consolidated Screening List API is not the system of record for these screening lists.  Developers should strongly encourage users to refer to the website of the source agency for further instructions when finding a potential match.  Links to these websites are found above as well as in the “Source List URL” and “Source Information URL” fields that accompany each party returned in the API.

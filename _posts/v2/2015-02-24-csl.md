#Consolidated Screening List API

{% include csl-tabs %}

##Resource URL

This endpoint will search across all eleven screening lists. It returns exact matches only at this time -- a user must perform searches on the exact spelling for a name.  To search a subset, see sources below.

{% include csl-query.html %}

##Search Parameters for consolidated screening list sources

###keyword

Searches for a match within the **name**, **alt_names**, **remarks**, and **title** fields from all eleven lists.

    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&q={term}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-keyword.html %}

###sources

Searches only the lists specified by the **Source** Abbreviation.

    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&sources={csl_type}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-source.html %}

Source Abbreviations as follows:

* Denied Persons List = **DPL**
* Entity List = **EL**
* Foreign Sanctions Evaders = **FSE**
* ITAR Debarred = **DTC**
* Non-SDN Iranian Sanctions Act List = **ISA**
* Nonproliferation Sanctions = **ISN**
* Palestinian Legislative Council List = **PLC**
* Part 561 List = **561**
* Sectoral Sanctions Identifications List = **SSI**
* Specially Designated Nationals - **SDN**
* Unverified List = **UVL**

###countries

Searches only parties whose **country** field matches the country code based on ISO [alpha-2 country codes](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/country_codes/country_names_and_code_elements.htm).  Note:  This method allows you to search for multiple countries (plural) but will only return one country (singular) per party.  

    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&countries={country code}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-country.html %}

###address

Searches against fields in the **addresses** array.

    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&address={query}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-address.html %}

###name

Searches against the **name** and **alt_names** fields.  

    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&name={query}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-name.html %}
 
###fuzzy_name

This parameter works in tandem with **name**. Set *fuzzy_name=true* to utilize fuzzy matching when searching against the **name** and **alt_names** fields. 

    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&fuzzy_name=true&name={query}

Searches return one of the following values. 

    100 - exact match
     95 - near match
     90 - exact match  distance = 1
     85 - near match   distance = 1
     80 - exact match  distance = 2
     75 - near match   distance = 2 
 
An *exact match* occurs when the query string is treated as a single token. 
A *near match* occurs when the query string is tokenized.
*Distance* refers to the distance between two strings as determined by [Damerau–Levenshtein distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance).

Fuzzy name matching enables users to query a name and get usable results without knowing the exact spelling.  The higher the score, the more likely the query matches a name in the consolidated screening list.  This is important for users who are searching for a name but do not know how the name is saved in the list.  Especially when most of those names have been translated from foreign languages.

**Note:**  hashtags (#) and ampersands (&) contained in a name search will alter the query.  Instead use **%23** for **#** and **%26** for **&**.  For example, to search on AT&T the query should read **name=at%26t**.


**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-fuzzy-name.html %}


###type

Searches based on the type of the entry (e.g, Individual, Entity, Vessel).

	{{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&type={entry type}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-type.html %}

###start_date

Returns entries based on their start date.  Dates are filtered by comparing them against an inclusive range, which must be entered with the following format:  YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd.  Searching on a single date can be done by entering the same value for the start and end of the range.


    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&start_date={YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-startdate.html %}

###end_date

Returns entries based on their end date.  Dates are filtered by comparing them against an inclusive range, which must be entered with the following format:  YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd.  Searching on a single date can be done by entering the same value for the start and end of the range.


    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&end_date={YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-enddate.html %}

###issue_date

Returns entries based on the issue dates of the ids array.  Dates are filtered by comparing them against an inclusive range, which must be entered with the following format:  YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd.  Searching on a single date can be done by entering the same value for the start and end of the range.


    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&issue_date={YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-issuedate.html %}

###expiration_date

Returns entries based on the expiration dates of the ids array.  Dates are filtered by comparing them against an inclusive range, which must be entered with the following format:  YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd.  Searching on a single date can be done by entering the same value for the start and end of the range.


    {{ site.webservices_baseurl }}/v2/consolidated_screening_list/search?api_key={your key}&expiration_date={YYYY-mm-dd TO YYYY-mm-dd}

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-expirationdate.html %}

###size + offset

The **size** parameter allows you to configure the number of results to be returned up to a maximum of 100. The **offset** parameter defines the offset from the first result you want to fetch. Unless specified the API returns 10 results at a time.

**_Example_**

{% include csl-query-size.html %}

##The Eleven Screening Lists, Their Sources and Specific Fields

## ITA’s Process for Consolidating the Screening Lists

ITA’s data services platform imports each of the eleven screening lists once a day.  It then consolidates the lists based on common field types such as name, Federal Register Notice number, and Start Date.  Not all lists contain the same fields so some search results may include more detail than others depending upon the Source agency.  Once the data services platform consolidates the lists, it publishes the [CSL API endpoint](http://api.govwizely.com/consolidated_screening_list/search).

There can be a time lag of up to one day between the time a Source has updated a screening list and when that update appears in the Consolidated Screening List API. Furthermore, the Consolidated Screening List API is not the system of record for these screening lists.  Developers should strongly encourage users to refer to the website of the source agency for further instructions when finding a potential match.  Links to these websites are found above as well as in the “Source List URL” and “Source Information URL” fields that accompany each party returned in the API.

This endpoint and its documentation has been updated to Version 2. Please visit the [API v1 Documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/v1-consolidated-screening-list.html) page for the Version 1 documentation.

#Apps for Exporters

ITA encourages developers to use the trade data in its APIs to build applications.  These data sets are particularly valuable because they originate from authoritative, federal government sources.  Developers can build applications that benefit businesses who export their products and services overseas.  They can also enhance their existing applications by mashing ITA’s data with other trade-related data.

We are particularly interested in applications that help businesses:

* Learn about exporting and have only just gotten started 
* Get ready to export and find where to start 
* Expand their existing exporting business.

##Applications Currently Using ITA's Data

*BusinessUSA* helps small businesses find the government resources they need.  Their [Exporting](http://business.usa.gov/export) section automatically populates its pages using ITA's [Trade Events](/trade-events.html) and [Offices & Centers](ita-office-locations.html) APIs.  Just click *Change Location* and enter a new zip code to see the results.

*Export USA* advertises itself as "the official showcase for American-made products and services" and helps U.S. exporters find overseas buyers and distributors.  [The Export USA home page](http://www.thinkglobal.us) provides Trade Resources for U.S. companies by displaying the most current [Market Research Reports](/market-research-library.html) and [Trade Events](/trade-events.html) from ITA.

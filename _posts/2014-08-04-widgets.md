### Trade Articles

The Trade News & Articles API provides in-depth news and articles written by federal trade specialists.  This widget enables users to enter a keyword and search all articles for that keyword across the title, body, and tag fields.

<div id="articles-container"></div>

### Trade Events

The Trade Events API provides data on events for U.S. businesses interested in selling their products and services overseas.<br />
<br />
There are two widgets available.  The first enables users to enter a keyword and search all events for that keyword across the title field. The second enables users to choose a particular Industry and/or a particular Country and find events that are tagged with both.

		The ITA Taxonomies API gives developers direct access to the exporting, trade, and investment terms that ITA uses to tag the content and data in its <a href="api-list.html">other APIs</a>.  Currently, ITA has four taxonomies:  Industries, Trade Topics, Geographic Locations, and U.S. Government.  This API includes all terms in their proper hierarchy in the relevant taxonomy.
		</p>
		<p>
		ITA imports data for its other APIs from many sources.  If the source data is already tagged, ITA does the following:
		<ul>
			<li>Imports those tags (terms) along with the data</li>
			<li>Maps the terms to ITA’s taxonomies</li>
			<li>Publishes both the original terms and the ITA terms with the data in the API.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>The output format for this API is JSON.  This data set is updated hourly.  Test the API using the <a href="http://internationaltradeadministration.github.io/explorer/#/ita-taxonomies">demo search app</a>. Be sure to <a href="http://api.trade.gov/">sign up for an API key</a> to get access to the API.</p>

		Having an established taxonomy enables developers to quickly search for particular content and data.  ITA tags content and data at the lowest, reasonable level of detail.
		</p>
		<p>
		ITA reviews and upgrades its taxonomies on a regular basis to ensure it reflects the content and data accurately.  As such, developers can be assured that when they perform a query on a particular term they will receive only the results that are relevant to that term.

		Use this API to populate drop downs, picklists, or a faceted navigation in your software.  You can also use this API to populate your own trade terms.

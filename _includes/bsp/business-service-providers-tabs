    <p>The Business Service Providers (BSP) API is a directory of U.S. and foreign-based businesses providing services that many small and medium sized exporters require to succeed in foreign markets.  Businesses can sign up to be a Service Provider on <a href='https://emenuapps.ita.doc.gov/ePublic/bsp-reg'>export.gov</a>.</p>
    <p>The output format for this API is JSON. This data set is updated hourly.</p>

    <p>The BSP directory is intended to provide an additional resource to U.S. exporters. The BSP directory is not comprehensive. Inclusion does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation by the International Trade Administration (ITA). ITA has performed limited due diligence research but strongly recommends that you perform your own due diligence investigation and background research on any company. ITA assumes no responsibility for the professional ability or integrity of the providers listed. ITA reserves the right not to list any particular company.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="pane" id="step3">
    <p>Business Service Providers are particularly helpful for U.S. companies that are just getting started exporting or that are looking to expand into a new market. Integrate the BSP directory into an “Export Resources” page that lets users search the BSP by geographic market or industry.</p>

		The Zip Code to USEAC API provides direct access to the U.S. Export Assistance Centers (USEACs) that have been assigned to all of the 40,000+ zip codes in the United States.  It’s not enough to do a proximity search for a zip code and a USEAC.  Each center has specialists on hand for each particular region.
		</p>
		<p>The output format for this API is JSON.  This data set is updated weekly.  Test the API using the <a href="http://internationaltradeadministration.github.io/explorer/#/ita-zip-codes">demo search app</a>.

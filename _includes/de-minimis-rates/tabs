      The De Minimis API provides data about the De Minimis amount and the Value Added Tax (VAT) amount
      that products may be subject to when exported to foreign countries.  “De Minimis”  is the threshold for a product’s value below which no duty or tariff is charged.  Furthermore, products below the De Minimis
      undergo minimal clearance procedures, such as customs and paperwork requirements.
      Similarly, the value of the exported products must exceed the VAT amount before it is subject to VAT.
    </p>
    <p>
      The API includes De Minimis and VAT amounts for almost 80 countries in that country’s currency.
      The output format for this API is JSON. This data set is updated only when the De Minimis or VAT
      amounts have been updated, which is usually once a year.

      U.S. companies interested in exporting their products to new foreign markets need to be aware of the
      tariff rates and taxes that their products may be subject to, in order to price products for the end customer.
      A U.S. company is less likely to be subject to tariffs if the value of their product falls below the
      De Minimis amount.  U.S. companies selling low value, small shipments are more likely to export to countries
      with high De Minimis levels.

      De Minimis and VAT are two factors in determining the “total landed cost” for exporting a product overseas.
      Use this data, along with the tariff data from <a href="tariff-rates.html">ITA’s Tariff Rates API</a> to improve your algorithm for
      computing landed cost.  Other factors to consider are:  packing charges, shipping and freight charges,
      and local taxes.

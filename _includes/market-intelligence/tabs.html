      The Market Intelligence API provides metadata for Country Commercial Guides and other
      market insight reports that are produced by ITA’s trade experts. ITA commercial officers
      that are stationed around the world, publish these authoritative reports in conjunction
      with Foreign Service officers from the State Department.

    <p>
      The API only provides the metadata and links to the reports – not the reports themselves.
      The output format for this API is JSON. This data set is updated daily.
